def filter_paths(movement, paths, time_threshold):
    r"""
    Return a list object containing start and end indices for
    movements lasting equal to or longer than the specified time
    threshold

    Parameters
    ----------
    movement : pandas.DataFrame
        CT, CX, CY coordinates and homebase status
        for the unique combination of strain, mouse and day
    paths: list
        a list containing the indices for all paths
    time_threshold : float
        positive number indicating the time threshold

    Returns
    -------
    paths index : a list containing the indices for all paths
    that the spending times are larger than a time threshold

    Examples
    --------
    >>> movement = data.load_movement(1, 2, 1)
    >>> paths = path_index(movement, 1, 1)
    >>> filter_paths(movement, paths, 20)
