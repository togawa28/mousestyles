def path_index(movement, stop_threshold, min_path_length):
    r"""
    Return a list object containing start and end indices
    for a specific movement. Each element in the list is
    a list containing two indices: the first element is
    the start index and the second element is the end index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    movement : pandas.DataFrame
        CT, CX, CY coordinates and homebase status
        for the unique combination of strain, mouse and day
    stop_threshold : float
        positive number indicating the path cutoff criteria
        if the time difference between two observations is
        less than this threhold, they will be in the same path

    min_path_length : int
        positive integer indicating how many observations in
        a path

    Returns
    -------
    paths index : a list containing the indices for all paths

    Examples
    --------
    >>> movement = data.load_movement(1, 2, 1)
    >>> paths = path_index(movement, 1, 1)[:5]
    >>> paths
    [[0, 2], [6, 8], [107, 113], [129, 131], [144, 152]]
